The chatbot is being created for a small business, a hair salon that provides hair braiding services and sells hairs and hair products to customers. The business receives calls from customers on a daily basis, asking the same type of questions regarding the services they provide. The goal of the bot is to create a virtual assistant that can answer these recurrent questions on the website, to decrease the number of calls made out to the business daily.

The project started with data collection. To collect the data, I had a meeting with customer service to understand the type of questions that customers usually call the business about to get a sense of the questions we can train the bot on, so it is able to provide the help customers need. I took note of these questions, which I later on based on to create a dictionary in python as a list of intents to feed the bot. 

Then preprocessed the data by implementing stop words removal and lower-case conversion, then lemmatized, tokenized the data, and trained the bot
